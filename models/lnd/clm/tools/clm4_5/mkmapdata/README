models/lnd/clm/tools/mkmapdata/README		Jan/17/2012

The routines in this directory create a mapping dataset from
SCRIP grid files to map from one grid to another. These mapping files
are used by either CLM or mksurfdata_map to regrid from one resolution
to another.

The script uses ESMF and requires that ESMF be built and the path
for ESMF binary files (using the program ESMF_RegridWeightGen) 
be given as input to the script.

Currently uses: ESMF5.2.0

Do the following for help with the different options to the script...

   ./mkmapdata.sh -help

The following steps provide a method to create the executable
and generate the grid map dataset:

0) Background tasks you only have to do once

 a.)  Export the input SCRIP grid files for the resolutions you'll need

  Most of these files are on the Subversion inputdata server at...

  https://svn-ccsm-inputdata.cgd.ucar.edu/trunk/inputdata/lnd/clm2/mappingdata/grids/

  Supported machines also have a copy on the CESM DIN_LOC_ROOT location
  for that machine.

 b.) Obtain and build a version of ESMF compatible with this script

The version needs to support ESMF_RegridWeightGen and support the
options passed to it in the mkmapdata.sh script.

   http://www.earthsystemmodeling.org/

1) cd to this directory 

2) Create map dataset(s)
   Option A.)  Use mkmapdata.sh directly
   run script(e.g.): (see header of mkmapdata.sh for other environment that can be set)

   Example for standard reslutions
        ./mkmapdata.sh -r 10x15
   Example for non-standard resolutions where you provide an input SCRIP grid file.
        ./mkmapdata.sh -f <SCRIP_gridfile>

   Option B.) Alternatively, run regridbatch.sh to run mkmapdata.sh for a bunch of 
        different resolutions.

   Option C.) Alternatively, run mknoocnmap.pl to create a single-point/regional
   map for an area without ocean.

   ./mknoocnmap.pl -help      # for help on this script

3) move (and rename if appropriate) generated map datasets
   to $DIN_LOC_ROOT/lnd/clm/mappingdata/maps, etc.


Important files:

  regridbatch.sh ------- Script to run mkmapdata.sh for many resolutions
  mvNimport.sh --------- Script to copy and import mapping files in for many resolutions
  mkmapdata.sh --------- Script to create mapping datasets for a given resolution

  mknoocnmap.pl -------- Script to create unity mapping dataset for single-point
                         or regional studies over land-only (no ocean).
  mkunitymap.ncl ------- NCL script to create a unity map -- ran by above script
