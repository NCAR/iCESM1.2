This directory contains simple test inputs to test cprnc.

The intention is that control.nc should be compared against each of
the other files here; each of these comparisons will test different
behavior of cprnc.

For example, run:

    cprnc test_inputs/control.nc test_inputs/diffs_in_vals.nc > cprnc.out

The files here are:

- control.nc: control file against which others should be compared

- copy.nc: copy of control file (i.e., no diffs)

- diffs_in_vals.nc: one variable has differences in values

- diffs_in_fill.nc: one variable has differences in fill pattern

- diffs_in_vals_and_diffs_in_fill.nc: one variable has differences in
  values, another has differences in fill pattern

- diffs_in_vals_and_fill.nc: a single variable has differences in both
  values and fill pattern

- vals_differ_by_1.1.nc: testvar has values equal to 1.1 times those
  in the control file. This is useful for testing the relative
  difference calculation.

  True values are the following (note that relative difference is
  defined using a denominator of max(v1,v2)):

  - RMS diff: 0.6204837 (printed as 6.2e-1)
  - avg rel diff: 0.0909091 (printed as 9.1e-2)
  - avg decimal digits: 1.041393 (printed as 1.0)
  - worst decimal digits: 1.041393 (printed as 1.0)

- vals_differ_by_1.1_somewhere.nc: similar to vals_differ_by_1.1.nc,
  but now only a single value differs by a factor of 1.1

  True values are the following (note that relative difference is
  defined using a denominator of max(v1,v2)):

  - RMS diff: 0.3162278 (printed as 3.2e-1)
  - avg rel diff: 0.009090909 (printed as 9.1e-3)
  - avg decimal digits: 1.041393 (printed as 1.0) [note that the
    average here ignores the indices with no difference]
  - worst decimal digits: 1.041393 (printed as 1.0)

- vals_differ_by_varying_amounts.nc: testvar has values equal to 1,
  1.01, 1.02, ..., 1.09 times those in the control file. This is
  useful for testing the relative difference calculation using more
  complex differences.

  True values are the following (note that relative difference is
  defined using a denominator of max(v1,v2)):

  - RMS diff: 0.4434862 (printed as 4.4e-1)
  - avg rel diff: 0.04233828 (printed as 4.2e-2)
  - avg decimal digits: 1.403306 (printed as 1.4) [note that the
    average here normalizes by 9 rather than 10, since the first index
    has a relative difference of 0]
  - worst decimal digits: 1.083184 (printed as 1.1)

- vals_differ_by_varying_amounts2.nc: First 8 values of testvar are
  identical to control; 9th is control * (1-1e-3), 10th is control *
  (1-1e-5). This is the same as the example given in ../README.

  True values are the following:

  - RMS diff: 0.002846226 (printed as 2.8e-3)
  - avg rel diff: 0.000101 (printed as 1.0e-4)
  - avg decimal digits: 4.0
  - worst decimal digits: 3.0
