clm/test/system/README					10/24/2012

Scripts for testing CLM and the CLM support tools with many different 
configurations and run-time options.

I.   MAIN SCRIPTS:

test_system ---- Run tests of the model specific for CLM
test_driver.sh - Test the CLM offline tools

To use...

./test_system
./test_driver.sh -i

Intended for use on NCAR machines: yellowstone, frankfurt.cgd, lynx, mirage, bluefire, 
and ORNL machine titan. And works on the MacBook laptop yongi.cgd. For most machines 
more than one compiler is supported.

II.  RUNNING test_system TESTING:

Basic use:

./test_system
./test_system --help # to get help on options

To generate files for a new tag and compare to a previous tag

./test_system --compare clm4_0_60 --generate clm4_0_61

Important files for test_system testing:

user_nl_dirs ---------------------------- Directories with namelist changes for testing

lynx.batch ------------------------------ Batch test runs for lynx
shortlist.batch ------------------------- Shortlist batch test runs for any machine
yellowstone.batch ----------------------- Batch test runs for yellowstone
lynx.interactive ------------------------ Interactive test runs for lynx
mirage.interactive ---------------------- Interactive test runs for mirage
shortlist.interactive ------------------- Shortlist Interactive test runs for any machine
yellowstone.interactive ----------------- Interactive test runs for yellowstone

III. RUNNING test_driver.sh TOOLS TESTING:

Basic use:

./test_driver.sh -i
./test_driver.sh -h   # to get help on options
 
Important environment variables (just used by test_driver.sh)

BL_ROOT ---------------- Root directory of CLM baseline code to compare to 
                         (if not set BL test will not be performed)
BL_TESTDIR ------------- Root directory of where to put baseline tests
CLM_INPUT_TESTS -------- Filename of file with list of tests to perform
CLM_TESTDIR ------------ Root directory of where to put most tests
CLM_RETAIN_FILES ------- If set to TRUE -- don't cleanup files after testing
CLM_FC ----------------- Use given compiler
CLM_JOBID -------------- Job identification number to use (rather than process ID)
CLM_THREADS ------------ Number of open-MP threads to use 
                         (by default this is set differently by machine)
CLM_SOFF --------------- If set to TRUE -- stop on first failed test

Important files for test_driver tools testing:

test_driver.sh ------- Main test script for tools
nl_files ------------- Directory with various namelists to test
config_files --------- Directory with various configurations to test
input_tests_master --- Master list of tests
tests_pretag_* ------- Tests for specific machines to do by default before a tag is done
tests_posttag_* ------ Tests for specific machines to do for more extensive testing 
                       after a tag is done
CLM_compare.sh ------- Compares output history files between two cases
T*.sh ---------------- Basic test script to do a specific type of test
gen_test_table.sh ---- Creates HTML table of tests
Makefile ------------- Will build the HTML table of tests
