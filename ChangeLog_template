One-line Summary:

List all component tags that were used to create cesm tag:

  scripts  
  drv
  share     
  cam
  clm     
  cice     
  cism        
  pop     
  datm       
  dlnd    
  dice    
  docn
  dead  
  stubs
  timing  
  esmf_wrf_timemgr
  mct     
  pio     


Describe the changes for each component above that was changed relative 
to the previous cesm tag in this sequence (this includes description
of new functionality and how user can use it):

Bugs fixed: 

Describe any changes made to scripts/build system:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

Code reviewed by:

Summary of pre-tag testing:

  Regression tests:
  regression test suite only tests original capability 
  regression test status of FAIL1 implies non-bfb
  regression test status of FAIL2 implies restart failure
  DO NOT create tag if FAIL2 status is obtained in any of the
  following regression tests

  Restart tests:
  Restart test suite tests both new and old capability 
  DO NOT create tag if FAIL status is obtained in any of the
  following restart tests

Summarize any change to answers (regressions tests status is FAIL1)

  - what code configurations:
  - what platforms/compilers:
  - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff but same climate; new
    climate): 

If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
than roundoff?

If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
climate in enough detail that it(they) could be reproduced, i.e.,

  - platform/compilers:
  - MSS location of output:

MSS location of control simulations used to validate new climate:
