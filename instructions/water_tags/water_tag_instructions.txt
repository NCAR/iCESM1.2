Steps for setting up a water tracer simulation in iCESM1.2:

1.  First, turn on water isotopes by following the instructions listed
    in "model_instructions.txt" present in the "water_isotope_files" tarball.
    However, do not build the model until the water tracer additions below have
    also been added.

2.  Next, copy the "atm_comp_mct.F90" file into your SourceMods/src.cam directory.  
    This file is where the actual water tracer boundaries are specified, and will
    thus need to be modified for any additional water tracers.  These additions are
    located in the "atm_import_mct" subroutine, in the "wtrc_nsrfvap" do-loop.

3.  Then, copy the "cam.buildnml.csh" file into your SourceMods/src.cam directory. If any
    additional water tracers are added to the run then search for this line of code:

    sed 's/DPCNST=50/DPCNST=71/g' < CCSM_cppdefs > CCSM_cppdefs_tmp

    and increase the second number by 7 for every new water tracer added.

4.  Finally, copy the "user_nl_cam" file into your case directory (or add the contents to your
    user_nl_cam file if you have already modified it).  For every new water tracer that is added,
    you will need to add the tracer names similar to the example "LND" and "NPAC" tracers already provided
    to the relevant namelist variables.  You will also need to add an additional 7 "H2O" quantities to the 
    "wtrc_species_names" variable, and an additional series of "VAPOR, LIQUID, ICE, etc." to the "wtrc_type_names" variable.

5.  Build the model (run *.build script in case directory).

6.  Run the model  (use either the *.run or *.submit script in case directory).

7.  Once the model is finished running, you should find variables with the same names you provided in user_nl_cam 
    in the history files that contain the associated water mass quantities for your water tracer.

Good luck!
