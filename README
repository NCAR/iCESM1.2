       The isotope-enabled Community Earth System Model version 1.2 (iCESM1.2)


iCESM1.2 is a version of NCAR's CESM1.2 with the ability to simulate water isotopes
(HDO and H218O) through the entire modeled hydrologic cycle, along with the ability to simulate
multiple different water tracers in the atmosphere (CAM5).  Instructions for running the model
with water isotopes or water tracers can be found in the "instructions" directory included in this
repository. Also, a scientific description of the model itself can be found online here:

Finally, if you have any questions or concerns regarding this model then please add a post to the
CESM forums:

and an NCAR scientist or engineer will respond to your query promptly.

Good luck!
